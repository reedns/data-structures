##Sorting Algorithms and Data Structures

This repo is an assortment of sorting algorithms and data-structures that I implemented in Ruby.  The purpose of these implementations is to become well versed in some computer science fundamentals and become a better developer.  For each of these implementations I wrote a test first and used red-green refactor write my code.  Below is the list of implementations.

###Algorithims
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Radix Sort

###Data Structures
- Singly Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Hash Table
- Binary Tree
- Deduplicating a Dobuly Linked List
